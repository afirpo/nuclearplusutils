# NuclearPlus Utils

Somewhat cheaty extra options to deal with *Nuclear Plus* and base game products.

## ATTENTION

You **must have** NotoriousPyro's *Nuclear Plus* mod.

### What is this ... slag?

This little [and frankly obtuse] mod will:
 1. Let you **flare** all 3-tiers *Spent Fuel Solution* (which of course comes with a cost by Air Pollution means);
 2. Let you **flare** both *Uranyl Nitrate* and *Plutonium Nitrate* solutions (again, that will cost pollution!);
 3. Trade *Uranium Pellets*, *Uranium Rods*, *Plutonium Pellets* and *Plutonium Rods* for *Gold* (refined one, not the ore) with the first Village on the World Map.
 
 All the credits goes to NotoriousPyro, of course, for his/her amazing work!
